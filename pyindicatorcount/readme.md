# hello! this is psychosophia's indicator counter
## and here's how it works..
### assuming you are a typist, you must have an idea of the dichotomies in psychosophy. now, you can mark them down and have this program count them for you.

> This is what the program recognizes as an indicator: <br>
> IND: Process Logic <br>
> IND: RiGid WiLl <br>
> ind: flexible emotion <br>

>Lowercase or not, doesn't matter.
 ### EXTRA: NUMERICAL INDICATOR LIST

> You can throw these anywhere in your text. It'll pick up on them.

Strong Indicators:<br>
IND1 = Strong Logic <br>
IND2 = Strong Will <br>
IND3 = Strong Physics <br>
IND4 = Strong Emotion <br>
Weak Indicators: <br>
IND5 = Weak Logic <br>
IND6 = Weak Will <br>
IND7 = Weak Physics <br>
IND8 = Weak Emotion <br>
Rigid/Flexible Indicators: <br>
IND9 = Rigid Logic <br>
IND10 = Rigid Will <br>
IND11 = Rigid Physics <br>
IND12 = Rigid Emotion <br>
IND13 = Flexible Logic <br>
IND14 = Flexible Will <br>
IND15 = Flexible Physics <br>
IND16 = Flexible Emotion <br>
Result Indicators: <br>
IND17 = Result Logic <br>
IND18 = Result Will <br>
IND19 = Result Physics <br>
IND20 = Result Emotion <br>
Process Indicators: <br>
IND21 = Process Logic <br>
IND22 = Process Will <br>
IND23 = Process Physics <br>
IND24 = Process Emotion <br>
> NOTE: When using these, beware: IND20 will also return 1 for IND2. This couldn't be prevented as of now. <br>
### EXAMPLE:

    So, I like engaging in dialogue just for the sake of it [IND: Process Logic]. But if it hurts my emotions, I'll give up right away, I have very strict boundaries regarding those. <- IND12

> This will return 1 for Process Logic and 1 for Rigid Emotion. <br>


### happy typing!
this is quite obviously a beginner project, so criticism is appreciated! <br>
